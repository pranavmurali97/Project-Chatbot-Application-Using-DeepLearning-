# Project-Chatbot-Application-Using-DeepLearning-

We are implementing the chatbot application using a feed forward neural network with a couple of hidden layers. We make use of PyTorch and ReLu activation function for the output layer. Tensorflow is used in the process and we follow NLP process of tokenization, stemming for building the model.
